<h3><span class="date">04/09/08:</span> Spatulas</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I went to the store and got some much-needed <span class="highlight">spatulas</span>! (What better way to say "I love myself" than to buy myself a <span class="highlight">spatula</span>?)</p>

<h3><span class="date">04/08/08:</span> Cookie Cupcakes</h3>
<p>My favorite cartoon character is <span class="highlight">Cookie</span>, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes. So Cookie Cupcakes are best of both worlds. Did you know? Cookie once said, "Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you." I wonder if the same applies for the cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)</p>
